# Overview
My MVC web framework for node.js. Work in Progress.

This framework is supposed to be:

1. It should be simple to use.

2. It should be asynchrous.

3. It should overcome shortcomings of single MVC. The problem of single MVC is that no View is rendered untile data is generated by Controller. For web, this is not good. Incremental flushing is preferred for better performance.
